Thise repo contains a number of not very big graphic programs find by me accross the internet.  
Each one is represent some rendering technique implemented with using OpenGL API. All of  
this programms written a while ago, code of this guys not necessary work with modern compilers  
(and may be because of some bugs). I try to fix some problems with couple of this guys and forced  
to work with GCC 11.2.0 in Ubuntu 21.04, but not all of them can build on my system in this  
condition.  
Important notice - All of this code is property of it's creators and some of this programs  
taken from internet archive version of frustum.org web page. Author of this page - Alexander Zapryagaev,  
a Russian developer, author Unigine game engine.
